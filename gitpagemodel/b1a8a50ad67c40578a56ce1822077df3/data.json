He is also losing the waxy coating on his skin which protected him while he was floating in the fluid inside your womb. \r\n\r\nYour baby is developing layers of fat under his skin, which will help keep him warm when he is born. Newborn babies need to be kept warm. The best way to do this is to hold him close to your chest inside your clothes.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder how you will know when labour starts. There are three ways that labour may begin. \r\n\r\n 1. You may notice a bloodstained discharge on your underwear. This is a sign that labour may begin in the next day or two. \r\n 2. You may have contractions that feel like period pains. They get that stronger, regular and more painful as labour progresses. \r\n 3. You may have a gush or trickle of water. If this happens you should go straight to the health facility.\r\n\r\nMake sure you know how to get to the health facility before labour starts. You need a midwife, nurse or doctor to care for you if you are in labour. Check that you have credit on your phone and money for a bus or taxi. \r\n",
