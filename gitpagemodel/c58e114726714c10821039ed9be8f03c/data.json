        "content": "Created by BabyCenter\r\n\r\nInside your womb, your baby wakes and sleeps at regular intervals now. He can now open and close his eyes, and suck his finger or thumb! This helps develop his sucking muscles so that he is strong enough to feed as soon as he is born. His brain is growing and developing quickly now.\r\n\r\nHe can respond to sound now. At first, he will only hear sounds from your body, like your heartbeat. But slowly he will start to hear noises from outside your body. Sing to your baby so he can hear your voice.\r\n\r\nIt may feel like your womb is up near your ribcage, which will make you feel out of breath. Eating can be difficult because your stomach may be squeezed by your growing baby. Have small meals more often and snacks between meals.\r\n\r\nAs your baby grows so does your womb. The skin over your belly stretches and this can itch.  You may notice red streaks on your tummy, hips, bottom and breasts.  They are stretch marks and they will fade to faint marks after you give birth.  You may have leg cramps or swollen veins.\r\n\r\nYour breasts are fuller and heavier now. This is because they are getting ready to make milk for your baby.",
