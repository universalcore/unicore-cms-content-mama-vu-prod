Or different in some way. But I feel totally normal! \r\n\r\nHonestly I can understand those girls who say that they didn\u2019t even know they were pregnant! If I hadn\u2019t missed a period and gone to the clinic for a test I would never have known. No morning sickness. No cravings. I feel nothing. My life just goes on as always.\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t stand garlic though\u2026 we actually have to throw out the garlic in the house because the smell is too much for me. I eat more. My mother complains because she isn\u2019t used to me eating so much (but I think she\u2019d probably complain if I didn\u2019t eat enough!)\r\n\r\nSo she fusses over me and I enjoy it. In fact I feel even better than I usually do! \r\n\r\nMy allergies seem to have disappeared \u2013 probably because of the good food I am eating. I am still active. My friends and family are shocked that I am still doing errands up to such a late date. But life continues doesn\u2019t it? I haven\u2019t gained too much weight and I only started showing late into my 5th month. \r\n\r\nMy worst symptom is the swollen feet! The baby is sitting more on my left side so my left foot has swollen up to almost double its size. It looks scary and ugly. Closed shoes are not an option and I only have one pair of sandals that I can wear. Or my house slippers! \r\n\r\nI worry my feet will permanently grow and then what kind of ladies\u2019 shoes will I find in such a big size?\r\n\r\n**MAMA HELP: Swollen feet (edema) during pregnancy can get worse as your due date nears. It may not be comfortable, but it\u2019s harmless and normal. It should ease up overnight. If it doesn\u2019t, or if your hands or face become puffy, visit your clinic for a check-up.** \r\n\r\n",
