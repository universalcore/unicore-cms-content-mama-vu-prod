He may enjoy opening and closing his fingers, or clapping his hands.\r\n\r\nYour baby's sense of humour is developing, too. A tickle or a noisy kiss on his tummy is likely to make him chuckle. \r\n\r\nRight from birth, your baby loves to be touched. It's important for his growth and development. About now, different textures will start to interest your baby\r\n\r\nAs he starts to understand the world, just playing helps your baby's brain to grow. As his brain develops, he is getting more curious. He may play with a small toy that he can hold and shake about. He will be learning about colour, shape and size, too. He also learns from the noise a toy makes and from feeling if it is soft or hard.\t\r\n\r\nAt this age, if he is on his belly, he may lift up his head and shoulders, using his arms for support.  Your baby may even be able to roll over from his front to his back. Encourage him by jiggling a toy on the side he usually rolls to. Clap and smile when he does! ",
