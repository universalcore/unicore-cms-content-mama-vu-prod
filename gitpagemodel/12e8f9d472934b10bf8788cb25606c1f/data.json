When he is born he will be able to see, taste, smell and hear. \r\n\r\nThe circle of darker skin around your nipples will be getting larger as your breasts grow. This helps your baby to find the breast once he is born and makes it easier for him to latch on and get milk. You may find your breasts grow quite quickly and feel much heavier. \r\n\r\nYour skin may be changing as well. Dark patches of skin may develop on your face. Or you may get a dark line down your tummy. These can be made worse by being out in the sun, so cover your skin and head, or stay in the shade. They will fade after your baby is born.\r\n\r\nPregnancy makes the joints in your body looser. So you may find you get aches and pains when you carry something heavy. Take care when lifting things. Divide heavy shopping into smaller loads. You may need more rest as well. Try to rest each afternoon and go to bed early if you are feeling tired. Growing a baby is hard work!",
